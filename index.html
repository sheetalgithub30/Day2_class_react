                ReactJS, also known as React, is a popular JavaScript library
                for building user interfaces. It is also referred to as a
                front-end JavaScript library. It was developed by Facebook and
                is widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web
                applications.

                React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs)
                on the web. React is a declarative, component based library that
                allows developers to build reusable UI components and It follows
                the{" "}

                  Virtual DOM
                </a>{" "}
                (Document Object Model) approach, which optimizes rendering
                performance by minimizing DOM updates. React is fast and works
                well with other tools and libraries.

                React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than
                directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. It performs necessary
                manipulations within this virtual representation before applying
                changes to the actual browser DOM. React is efficient, altering
                only what requires modification.
